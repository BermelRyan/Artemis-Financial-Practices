# Artemis-Financial-Practices
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client this time was Artemis Financial and they were looking for a system to allow their customers to chose and purchase plans online with ease. They were also looking to make sure that all the inputted information was safe and secure.


What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
It is important to code securely so that outside threats suchs as hackers don't get the private information from the clients that use the system. Software security boosts a company's credibility to bring in more clients.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of the whole assessment was identifying the vulnerabilites and the false positives.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase the security levels I incorperated an SSL certificate as well as ensureing it had HTTP posts.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
In order to ensure that the code was functional, I ran the code several times as well as running dependency checks. When refactoring the code I ran the system to check for new vulnerabilites.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The most helpful resource I found was viewing the system with the web browser in eclipse.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show off my Vulnerability Assessment Report to show my understanding of how to locate and decipher the information given.
